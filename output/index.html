					<div class="content">
					<p>What you can probably spot from past posts on my blog, my open source contributions are heavily focused on <a href="https://weblate.org/">Weblate</a> and I've phased out many other activities. The main reason being reduced amount of free time with growing family, what leads to focusing on project which I like most. It's fun to develop it and it seems like it will work business wise as well, but that's still something to be shown in the future.</p>
<p>Anyway it's time to admit that I will not spend much time on other things in near future.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, I've resigned from being <a href="https://www.phpmyadmin.net/">phpMyAdmin</a> project admin. I was in this role for three years and I've been contributing to the project <a href="https://blog.cihar.com/archives/2006/03/15/muj-free-software-2-phpmyadmin/">for 18 years</a>. It has been time, but I haven't contributed significantly in last few months. I will stay with the project for few more months to handle smooth transition, but it's time to say good bye there.</p>
<p>On the <a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> project I want to stay active, but I've reduced my involvement and I'm looking for maintainers for <a href="https://qa.debian.org/developer.php?login=nijel&amp;comaint=yes">some of my packages</a> (mostly RPM related). The special case is the phpMyAdmin package where I was <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/879741">looking for help since 2017</a>, but it still didn't help from the package becoming heavily outdated with security issues what lead to it's removal from Buster. It seems that this has <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/879741">triggered enough attention</a> to resurrect work on the updated packages.</p>
<p>Today I've gone through my personal repos on GitHub and I've <a href="https://github.com/nijel?type=archived&amp;tab=repositories">archived bunch of them</a>. These have not received any attention for years (many of them were dead by the time I've imported them to GitHub) and it's good to clearly show that to random visitors.</p>
<p>I'm still main developer behind <a href="https://wammu.eu/">Gammu</a>, but I'm not really doing there more than occasional review of pull requests and merging them. I don't want to abandon the project without handing it out to somebody else, but the problem is that <a href="https://github.com/gammu/gammu/issues/475">there is nobody else right now</a>.</p>

I &nbsp;engaged in a mix of bug fixes and improvements (including refactoring) during the fortnight. The bugs fixed and attended are as follows.</div>
<br />
<b>Bugs fixed</b><br />

issue #12085 Like search strings being escaped incorrectly<br />

<div style="text-align: justify;">
I went on to refactor the code that handled bookmarks. I used object orientation and updated the existing unit tests to suit the refactored code. Moreover, I updated the metro theme to be compatible with the upcoming 4.6.0 version, so phpMyAdmin has, at least, one additional theme compatible with the new version.</div>

During the&nbsp;nineteenth and twentieth weeks, I was away from work between 2nd Feb to 10th Feb. However, during the rest of the days, I engaged in both code refactoring and bus fixes. Early on the fortnight, I refactored the server binary logs page to use the MVC architecture. This included introducing a controller class, using templating and updating unit tests.</div>

My work during these two weeks concentrated pretty much on the security vulnerabilities that were reported. We received two lengthy reports on a number of security vulnerabilities which included cross-site scripting, full path disclosure, weaknesses in token generation and comparison etc. Altogether these vulnerabilities resulted in 9 PMASAs taking into the different combinations of phpMyAdmin versions they affected.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
I contributed by fixing some vulnerabilities, testing security patches, porting some fixes done by others developers to older branches, preparing PMASAs and coordinating with the reporter, CVE team and phpMyAdmin security team.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
The latter part of the fortnight was spent on fixing two regressions introduced by the security releases.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
issue #11891&nbsp;Error with PMA 4.0.10.13 with PHP 5.2</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
issue #11892&nbsp;Error with PMA 4.4.15.3</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">

During the week, I concentrated solely on bug fixes since there were a sizable number of bugs being reported. Most of the bugs fixed were regressions. For example, #11771 and&nbsp;#11846 were only present in latest git version and was due to refactoring and JS library updates respectively.</div>

With my personal engagements and summer break, I worked only for 13 hours during the three weeks. During the period, I was mostly engaged with refactoring work and improving the unit testing.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Continuing from the last couple of weeks, I refactored the server plugins page to use the MVC architecture. Code segments that were previously in a library file were moved to a controller class and instance variables were introduced as required. The view was changed to use templating and unit tests were updated to match the new classes.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
I also went on to improve the unit testing by introducing a parent class to all the unit tests. With the new class, configuration values are reset to their default values for each test class. The idea was to make unit tests independent from changes made to configuration values in other unit tests. Meanwhile, unnecessary configuration values assignments in tests were removed.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Additionally, following bugs were investigated during the period.</div>

During the two weeks most I attended a mix of bug fixing, implementing new features, refactoring and unit test improvements.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
I did not realize that some of the unit tests were not running as part of the test suite unit Michal pointed out and included them. However, this caused quite some test failures as most of the recently added and updated tests had not been running. These were fixed at the very beginning of the period.</div>

Quite a number of bugs were fixed during the two weeks and some more were investigated. Following are the list of bug fixes attended.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<b>Feature Enhancements</b></div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
